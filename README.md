# Kekspos√©

_**Expose** your **Kafka** cluster outside your Minikube, Kind, or Docker Desktop Kubernetes clusters._

[![Kekspos√©: Expose your Kafka outside your Minikube, Kind, or Docker Desktop Kubernetes clusters](http://img.youtube.com/vi/EOpWH9gfKmU/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOpWH9gfKmU "Kekspos√©: Expose your Kafka outside your Minikube, Kind, or Docker Desktop Kubernetes clusters")

## What is Kekspos√©?

[Strimzi](https://strimzi.io) makes it easy to run [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) on Kubernetes.
But using the Kafka cluster from applications running outside of your Kubernetes cluster can be [challenging](https://strimzi.io/blog/2019/04/17/accessing-kafka-part-1/).
Strimzi tries to make it as easy as possible and supports several different ways how to _expose_ the Kafka cluster:
* Using Load Balancers
* Using Node Ports
* Using the Kubernetes Nginx Ingress controller

When running in production-grade Kubernetes environments, these usually work fine.
But when using a local Kubernetes cluster such as Minikube, Kind or Docker Desktop, these mechanisms are often not well-supported:
* The local clusters often lack proper support for load balancers
* They often run inside additional virtual machines or containers and use complex networking so that node ports do not work out of the box
* While Ingress usually works, the installation of the right Ingress controller and its configuration is often complicated 

One of the ways how applications are often exposed from local clusters is using port forwarding with `kubectl port-foward`.
But using port forwarding with Apache Kafka is not so simple because of its custom discovery protocol.
You need to forward ports for each brokers in the Kafka cluster.
And you need to make sure your advertised hosts and ports are correctly configured to the local address.
Kekspos√© makes it possible to use port forwarding with Apache Kafka with the help of [Kroxylicious](https://kroxylicious.io/) project that provides Kafka proxying capabilities. 

## How does it work?

Kekspos√© finds a listener without TLS encryption on your Strimzi-based Apache Kafka clusters and exposes it.
It deploys a Kafka proxy based on the [Kroxylicious](https://kroxylicious.io/) project into your Kubernetes cluster and configures it to manage the advertised hosts and ports in the Kafka metadata.
It also creates a port-forward for each of the Kafka brokers in your cluster.
The advertised hosts and ports are changed by the Kroxylicious proxy to the local addresses of the forwarded ports.
Your Kafka clients can then connect to the forwarded ports and through the proxy to the Kafka cluster to send and receive messages.

Kekspose is written in Java using the [Quarkus framework](https://quarkus.io/).
That allows it to provide native binaries to make it easier to run Kekspos√©.

## How to use Kekspos√©?

### Installation

You can download one of the release binaries from one of the release and use it.
Alternatively, you can also checkout the project and run it from your IDE or from command line with the `mvn quarkus:dev` command.

### Configuration

Kekspos√© supports several parameters that can be used to configure it:

| Option                   | Description                                                                                                                                                         | Default Value                             |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `--namespace` / `-n`     | Namespace of the Kafka cluster. This is also the namespace where the Kekspos√© proxy will be deployed. Defaults to the namespace form your Kubernetes configuration. |                                           |
| `--cluster-name` / `-c`  | Name of the Kafka cluster.                                                                                                                                          | `myproject`                               |
| `--listener-name`/ `-l`  | Name of the listener that should be exposed. If not set, Kekspos√© will try to find a suitable listener on its own.                                                  |                                           |
| `--starting-port` / `-p` | The starting port number. This port number will be used for the bootstrap connection and will be used as the basis to calculate the per-broker ports.               | `50000`                                   |
| `--kekspose-name` / `-k` | Name that will be used for the Kekspos√© ConfigMap and Pod.                                                                                                          | `kekspose`                                |
| `--timeout` / `-t`       | Timeout for how long to wait for the Proxy Pod to become ready. In milliseconds.                                                                                    | `300000`                                  |
| `--proxy-image` / `-i`   | Container image used for the proxy (must be based on a compatible Kroxylicious container image)                                                                     | `quay.io/kroxylicious/kroxylicious:0.5.0` |

If you are using the Kekspos√© binary, you can just pass the options form the command line.
When using the Quarkus Dev mode, you can pass options using the `quakrus.args` system property - e.g. `mvn quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.args="--help"`.  

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does Kekspos√© support Kafka clusters with authentication?

Kekspos√© requires a listener without TLS encryption.
But it supports Kafka clusters with SASL based authentication such as SCRAM-SHA or OAuth. 

### What happens when I scale my Kafka cluster?

You might need to restart Kekspos√© after scaling up your Kafka cluster or changing the IDs of the Apache Kafka nodes.

### Does Kekspos√© support KRaft-based Apache Kafka clusters?

Kekspos√© supports Kraft-based Apache Kafka cluster.
However, it exposes the broker nodes only.

### What access rights do I need to run Kekspos√©?

Running Kekspos√© requires the following access rights to your Kubernetes cluster:
* Reading the Kafka and KafkaNodePool Strimzi resources from the selected namespace
* Creating and deleting a Pod with the Kroxylicious proxy and a ConfigMap with configuration in the same namespace as the Kafka cluster runs
* Needs to be able to forward ports from the proxy Pod

### Does Kekspos√© work only with local Kubernetes clusters?

Kekspos√© was designed with focus on local Kubernetes environments such as Minikube, Kind, or Docker Desktop.
But it can be used with any Kubernetes cluster regardless of how and where you run it.

### Can the same Kafka cluster be exposed to multiple users in parallel?

Any user that has access to the Kubernetes cluster and the necessary rights can expose it.
But in order to be able to expose the Kafka cluster, Kekspos√© has to deploy the proxy into the Kubernetes cluster.
So if the same cluster should be exposed in parallel to multiple users, it is important that they each use their own value for the `--kekspose-name` option to make sure each user has a custom proxy instance. 

### What does the name Kekspos√© mean?

It is a combination of several words: `Kafka`, `Expose` ... and `Keks` (biscuit) because everyone likes them üòâ.

## Building

You can build the native binary after installing the GraalVM and running `mvn package -Pnative`.
